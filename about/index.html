<p class="no-top-margin">Yo!  I'm Jason, a front-end developer who loves building cool things!  I enjoy building small reusuable components and modules to create larger complex mobile and web applications.  I hate repeating myself, in code and conversation.<p>

<p>I live in the greatest city in the world with my beautiful fianc&eacute;, Danielle.  I currently work for About.com, using technologies like Java, Freemarker, Javascript, MongoDB, Solr, XML, and SASS.  I also have exprience with PHP, JSP, Perl, Python, Ruby, CSS (obviously), and C++.  In my spare time I work on side projects for clients in addition to creating and contributing to multiple open source projects.</p>

<p>I'm excited with where the web is going and hope to be apart of the next big thing.  I'm excited by JS frameworks and tooling to help speed up development.  Some of my gotos are Yeoman, AngularJS, Gridle, Foundation, Bootstrap, Grunt, and Brew.  I'm sure there are more that are just slipping my mind.  Be sure to check out my blog to find out how I use these tools to improve my productivity, code maintainablity, and simplfy my workflow.</p>

<p>I also have a love for music.  I've been playing the piano since I was about 6 and would listen to anything that had a good beat.  Today, when I'm not behind my computer coding, I'm behind a keyboard making a beat - hiphop, R&amp;B, pop, or edm.  Recently though, I have found myself behind my mirrorless Fujifilm X-E2 a lot.  Be sure to check out my gallery, all photos shot by me.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting.  Hopefully you found what you were looking for; if not or if you have an idea don't hesitate to reach out.  Let's work!</p>
