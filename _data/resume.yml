    A computer science professional capable of managing technology projects from conception to completion with remarkable deadline sensitivity and with a strong sense of aesthetics and attention to details. Strong analytical skills combined with experience in object oriented programming and graphic design techniques allow me to solve complex design and development issues. I am a compatible team player willing to tackle tasks throughout various stages of the product lifecycle. I excel in team collaboration, solution brainstorming, and ideation sessions.  I enjoy a good challenge and I'm always looking to learn something new.
