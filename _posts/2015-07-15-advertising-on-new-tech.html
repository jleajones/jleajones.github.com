<p>New technology requires new techniques.  This have been evident in the advertising industry for decades.  Radio, TV, internet on computer screen, internet on latptop, tablet, and phone.  The industry is on the verge of facing another blow which will force a dramatic pivot in the way advertisments are created, targeted, and served.  Now that people use there mobile devices more we have already begun to see a shift.  IAB standards have changed, creating new 'standard' sizes.  Advertisemnet libraries and software have improved performance and added settings to control what happens for different types of devices.  The migration to the smart watch will be no different.</p>


<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm sure it will be great for the end user in about 2-5 years.  But it will suck for the advertiser (making it EVEN better for the end user).  Any way, its shear mathmatics:  The screen is ALOT smaller.  App developers may not even be able to afford to sell screen real estate.</p>
