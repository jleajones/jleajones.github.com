Sooo...after my last boys trip to Cancun my fiance has graciously allowed me to go to Vegas with my boy Sam.  (P.S. Drake has no idea what he is talking about, I make new friends all the time!)  This is strictly a gambling trip so Danielle wouldn't have even enjoyed herself anyway &ndash; or she would have spend all my money playing blackjack.

I'm super excited about the opportunity to just grind at the Poker table and hang out with Sam.  We may hit the strip club, but going out and spending money is not really on the agenda.  We are staying at the Linq mainly becuase I love Hash-n-Go-Go but also its centrally located on the strip and was relatively cheap.  Supposedly they also have pretty good action at the poker tables, but thats yet to be confirmed.
