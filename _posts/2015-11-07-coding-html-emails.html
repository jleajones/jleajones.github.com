Email marketing is huge.  I get at least 20 HTML emails a day from companies and other companies have large contracts and make a lot of money buidling, maintaining, and distributing these emails.  Needless to say, email clients haven't evolved like browsers in terms of parsing and rendering HTML and CSS.  Therefore, creating these emails can be a pain!
