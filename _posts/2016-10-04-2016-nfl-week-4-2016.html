<p>Julio Jones was a beast.  So was Matt Ryan I suppose.  I haven't done the research but I just feel like 300 receiving
    yards is higher on the Top Lists than 500 passing.  Needless to say they went off and luckily I started both of them
    in TFFA and damn near scored 200pts, 197 to be exact.  I got the win and moved to 2-2.  Next week I face the current
    #1 ranked and only undefeated team and he has 4 New Orleans Saints on bye.  I'm hoping I can sneak in a win.</p>

<p>The New England Patriots lost, which will be overlooked and forgotten about <s>if</s> when we win next week with the
    return of Brady.  In terms on post Brady...we've got work to do.</p>

<p>I went 1-2 in my fantasy leagues.  I'm pretty much f*** in Crazy Points League.  Eli Manning is not going to cut it
    as QB if he keeps this up.  He did go up against the Vikings, so I'm hoping for better next week.  Even if Manning
    does better my running backs are suspect and its killing me in the point per carry scoring.  Latavius Murray has
    moved to a time-share thing and I'm picking backups off the wavier wire trying to combat injuries.</p>

<p>I do have a chance in the other 2 leagues.  My matchup this week in the new league was close, but I lost; even with
    AJ Green.  My opponent had Big Ben and AB and Drew Brees didn't show up. I could have made a better line up to beat
    his starting lineup, but his best lineup beat my best so its all good.  I'm now 3-1 and had 2 people on bye.
    Hopefully I can bounce back next week even with Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints on bye against the last ranked
    team in the league.</p>
