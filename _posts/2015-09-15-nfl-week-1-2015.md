As always Week 1 of the NFL did not disappoint.  It was filled with big injuries, big upsets, big performances, and big busts.<br/><br/>

##Steelers @ Patriots (21, 28)
Luckily I was able to watch my #PATS on #TNF while in #AbuDhabi.  I don't remember what channel it was exactly but they had 2 channels with an english and french translation.  The commericals were in Arabic which was a constant reminder I was up at 4:00AM local time watching this game.  Any way it was crystal clear **Tom Brady** is still machine, sharp as ever looking to make a statement.  Gronk is still Gronk, 5/94/3.  I'm excited about **Dion Lewis**.  He had a pretty good game and look forward to see if he can keep this up all season.  Our D needs work as usual.  Pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a Patriot team, we bend but don't break.  Roethlisberger threw for 351 yards and 1 TD, Williams ran for 138 yards, and Antonio Brown had 9 catches for 133 yards and 1 TD.<br/><br/>

##Dolphins @ Redskins (17, 10)
Alot of hype has been made over the Phins during this past off season.  They looked to struggle a little againts Washington, but were able to win a close one.<br/><br/>

##Colts @ Bills (14, 27)
Are the Bills legit, are the Colts falling off? **Frank Gore**, **Andrew Luck**, **T.Y. Hilton**, Bill Defense, **LeShawn McCoy**, **Tyrod Taylor**<br/><br/>

##Browns @ Jets (10, 31)
The #JETS have always been known for their defense and now with an even better secondary some additional weapons on offense, they were able to make quick work of the Cleveland Browns.  I'm not sure who the Browns are yet, so I'll have to watch the Jets in the upcoming weeks to determine if I believe them.  **Brandon Marshall** **Ryan Fitzpatrick**  **Josh McCown**<br/><br/>

##Chiefs @ Texans (27, 20)

##Lions @ Chargers (28, 33)
**Megatron** **Phillip Rivers** **Keenan Allen**<br/><br/>

##Saints @ Cardinals (19, 31)

##Ravens @ Broncos (13, 19)
**Peyton Manning**<br/><br/>

##Bengals @ Raiders (33, 13)
TODO<br/><br/>

##Titans @ Buccaneers (42, 14)
**Marcus Mariotta** looked great in the first half connecting with 8 different receivers and throwing for 4TDs.  He obviously slowed down a little in the 2nd half but overall had a great NFL debut.  **Jameis Winston** started off slow but picked it up the 2nd half.  I look forward to seeing him progress over the season especially when he gets **Mike Evans** back.<br/><br/>

##Giants @ Cowboys (26, 27)
**Dez Bryant** **Tony Romo** **Eli Manning**<br/><br/>

##Eagles @ Falcons (26, 24)
TODO<br/><br/>

##Vikings @ 49ers (3, 20)
**Carlos Hyde, Carlos Hyde, Carlos Hyde**!  I'm was excited to see him 'have a day' for multiple reasons.  First he is on my fantasy team (33pts PPR) lets hope he can keep that up, but also because he is from THE Ohio State University.  **Adrian Petterson** had an underwhelming performance.<br/><br/>

###Fantasy Update

####TFFA 91-138 (W)
As I mentioned above, **Carlos Hyde** held me DOWN.  I had **Tyler Eifert** (33pts), **Jarvis Landry** (20pts), and **Ameer Abdulah** (19pts) all on my bench and all out scored multiple starters.  **Eli Manning** let me down and **Dez Bryant** and **Andre Ellington** getting injured really killed me.  Need to make some good decisions next week and for the rest of the season to win this chip.

####Talking Wreckless on FB 207-211.5 (W)
Going into the Monday night game I thought this was a sewed up.  I had a 48 point lead with **Cody Parkey (K)** still to play against **Telvin Coleman (RB)**, **Harrison Smith (DB)** and **Phil Dawson (K)**.
