Its thats time of the year again when we celebrate a horrific event in US history.  The good news is most people like me will spend it with their families and see relatives they may not on a regular basis.  Being that my fiance's fam is in LI and mine is in Jersey, we usually spend most of the day traveling, but not this year.

We decided that running up and down the turnpike was a waste of money and time.  So we spend this turkey day (shout to my cousing Raven) in Jersey with my fam, and we will spend Christmas with her family.  I feel like thats how most couples do it and it makes the most sense, so your're not showing up after dinner or people have left.  Enough about logistics, and more about the spread.  

As long as I can remember, when my grandmother was healthy, she would throw down and cook everything.  My mom, aunts, cousins, and uncles would make a dish or two, but my grandmother held us down.  She has alhizmers now and can't cook like she used to anymore, but I must admit...her children and grandchildren did her proud.  My aunt made... and my mother made...  My cousin Edwena made her famous mac-n-cheese (delish).  My fiance Danielle, made peach cobbler which was really good.  My uncle made...

On top of all the great food, I got hang with my younger cousins CJ amd NyAsha who are growing up super fast and my family was super excited to see me and Danielle.
