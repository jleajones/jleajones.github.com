Another birthday down!  One of the things I love about my birthday being in July is that I have half a year to reflect
on my progress towards reaching <a>the goals and changes i set forth to accomplish that year</a>.  Not only am I excited
with the progress I've made since Jan. 2016, but 30 was very good to me.
