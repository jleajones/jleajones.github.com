Being that we are fixing to move, its a perfect time to get rid of old shit!  All my PS3 stuff made the list.  I bagged up all my games, both PS3 consoles (original fat one and a newer slim one), and all accessories and headed to Game Stop.  My original plan was to just turn that stuff in a get cash.  I'm 30, I have no time for video games, right. WRONG!
