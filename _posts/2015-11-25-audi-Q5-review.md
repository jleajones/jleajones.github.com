We decided to move to suburbs from NYC and definitely needed a car to get around.  Originally Danielle, wanted a Jeep Wrangler but the ride wasn't all that great and it was priced like a luxury car.  Audi was having their annual holiday sale so we went to check it out Q5.  From the very first moment I stepped on the gas, I knew...this was the car!
